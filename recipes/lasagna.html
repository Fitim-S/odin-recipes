     <p>lasagna, pasta dish of Italian origin, made with broad often ruffled noodles and a tomato or white sauce.
        Lasagna, in the singular, is a southern Italian variation of what northern Italians call lasagne, in the plural.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>500g beef mince</li>
        <li>Passata</li>
        <li>Lasagna sheets</li>
        <li>White sauce</li>
        <li>125g Mozzarella</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>To make the meat sauce, heat 2 tbsp olive oil in a frying pan and cook 
            750g lean beef mince in two batches for about 10 mins until browned all over.</li>
        <li>Finely chop 4 slices of prosciutto from a 90g pack, then stir through the meat mixture.</li>
        <li>Pour over 800g passata or half our basic tomato sauce recipe and 200ml hot beef stock. Add a little grated nutmeg, then season.</li>
        <li>Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4 and lightly oil an ovenproof dish</li>
        <li>Spoon one third of the meat sauce into the dish, then cover with some fresh lasagne sheets
             from a 300g pack. Drizzle over roughly 130g ready-made or homemade white sauce.</li>
        <li>Repeat until you have three layers of pasta. Cover with the remaining 390g white sauce, making sure you canâ€™t see any pasta poking through.</li>     
        <li>Scatter 125g torn mozzarella over the top.</li>
        <li>Arrange the rest of the prosciutto on top. Bake for 45 mins until the top is bubbling and lightly browned.</li>
    </ol>
