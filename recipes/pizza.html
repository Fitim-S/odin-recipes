     <h2>Pizza background</h2>
     <p>Pizza is a baked Italian dish of flattened bread dough topped with various ingredients, and is typically served hot</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>dough</li>
        <li>passata</li>
        <li>basil</li>
        <li>garlic</li>
        <li>mozzarella</li>
        <li>parmesan</li>
        <li>cherry tomatoes</li>
        
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the sauce: Mix the passata, basil and crushed garlic together, then season to taste. Leave to stand at room temperature while you get on with shaping the base.</li>
        <li>Roll out the dough: if youâ€™ve let the dough rise, give it a quick knead, then split into two balls. On a floured surface, roll out the dough into large rounds, about 25cm across, using a rolling pin. The dough needs to be very thin as it will rise in the oven. Lift the rounds onto two floured baking sheets.</li>
        <li>Top and bake: heat the oven to 240C/220C fan/gas 8. Put another baking sheet or an upturned baking tray in the oven on the top shelf. Smooth sauce over bases with the back of a spoon. Scatter with cheese and tomatoes, drizzle with olive oil and season. Put one pizza, still on its baking sheet, on top of the preheated sheet or tray. Bake for 8-10 mins until crisp. Serve with a little more olive oil, and basil leaves if using. Repeat step for remaining pizza.</li>
